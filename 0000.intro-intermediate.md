# Preface

Here are 5 tips that any intermediate Python developer could start using.
(I'm saying these are for “intermediate” developers because they require some knowledge about the language that goes beyond the bare basics.)
These tips should be useful and generally applicable, and I hope they help you out on your Python journey!
